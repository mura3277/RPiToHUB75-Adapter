# Raspberry Pi 4 40 Pin GPIO to HUB75 Adapter Board

This PCB converts pins 23-40 to the HUB75 header. The remaining pins 1-22 are mapped to the remaining 20-pin header. It is intended this is used with the [RGB LED Matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master) library with a custom mapping as this adapter accesses different GPIO from the regular pin mapping.
